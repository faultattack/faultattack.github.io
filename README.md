Workshop material package
---------------------------
We want people to continue experimenting after the conference, hence, we built an affordable workshop package for some of the participants to take home. 
We have 7 packages available and will fill the workshop pre-reserved seats starting from those who commit to attending with an advance purchase. 

We are not in this to make a profit (just to smash stacks). We are offering the workshop materials package for 82€. 

The package includes: 
  - PicoEMP (picoemp.com) kit fully assembled and ready to use. (77 € at cost price)
  - Raspberry Pi Pico (about 5€) 
  - Disobey 2017 badge as a practice target (priceless) 
All this should be cheaper than what you can get on your own.
