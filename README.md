Workshop sign-up is intended for those who want to experiment on their own. 

The workshop sign-ups will go live on Monday 6th of February. 

We want people to continue experimenting after the conference, hence, we built an affordable workshop package for some of the participants to take home. 
We have 7 packages available and will fill the workshop pre-reserved seats starting from those who commit to attending with an advance purchase.
