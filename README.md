# Disobey 2023 Workshop on Fault Injection Attacks 

Workshop Schedule 
==================

  - Introduction to Fault Injection Attacks
     - What are the underlying principles in fault attacks 
     - Methodology to exploit 
  - Short Q&A 
  - Hands-on session start

Workshop Capacity
=================
Everyone is welcome to attend the workshop intro lecture. At least as long as there is space in the room. Hands-on part has more restricted capacity. The hands-on devices were reserved in a pre-conference registration round. There might be some observer/co-working spots left when the session starts. 

The hands-on part of the workshop has been created for people who are beginners with fault injection attacks. If you have more experience you're welcome to join and show us your tricks :). Experience with simple scripts as well as compiling and running software will be useful. 


Notes for Hands-on Attendees

You will need to bring a laptop, or team up with someone who has a laptop.

Fashionable accessories your laptop should have:

  - spare micro-USB cable (preferred)
  - Stickers with glitter (1-2 is enough)

Development tools you may want to pre-install 
  - cmake, arm-none-eabi-gcc, (picoSDK)
  - Disassembler 
(Cutter.re, Radare2, IDA, Ghidra, Hopper... many possibilities)
 - Putty or some other command line utility like screen for USB tty   
  - Arduino IDE (optional)
  - pwntools/USBSerial for python 



Workshop hardware material package
----------------------------------
We want people to continue experimenting after the conference, hence, we built an affordable workshop package for some of the participants to take home. 

We had 7 packages available and all are sold out now. 

The package includes: 
  - PicoEMP (picoemp.com) kit fully assembled and ready to use. 
  - Raspberry Pi Pico 
  - Disobey 2017 badge as a practice target (priceless)
